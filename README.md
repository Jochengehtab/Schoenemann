# About
This is a simple chess engine written in C++. The name was inspired by this chess line in the Ruy Lopez:
```
1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 f5 4. d4 fxe4 5. Nxe5 Nxe5 6. dxe5 c6 7. Nc3 *
```
in this it seems that white is hanging a bishop but is not worst.
It has currently a strenght about ~2660 Elo (Tested againtst Laser 1.7 STC)

# How it works
Currently it is using a NNUE with 512 Hidden Layers and Leela data and uses a simple Alpha-Beta Search.

# Install
Type 
  ```
  make all
