# About
This is a simple chess engine written in C++. The name was inspired by this chess line in the Ruy Lopez:
```
1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 f5 4. d4 fxe4 5. Nxe5 Nxe5 6. dxe5 c6 7. Nc3 *
```
in this it seems that white is hanging a bishop but is not worse.

# How it works
-  NNUE with 512 Hidden Layers
-  Trained with Leela Data

-  PVS-Search
-  SEE Prunning + MoveOrdering
-  Check Extension
-  MVA - LVV in MoveOrdering

# Build
Type 
  ```
  make all
  ```
This will produce an executable with the name of ```null.exe```
