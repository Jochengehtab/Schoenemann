## About  
**Schönemann** is a chess engine inspired by this fascinating line in the Ruy López:  
```
1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 f5 4. d4 fxe4 5. Nxe5 Nxe5 6. dxe5 c6 7. Nc3 *
```  
At first glance, it may appear that White is hanging a bishop, but they are not at a disadvantage.

- **NNUE** with 1024 hidden layers, trained using **Monty** data (Currently doing selfgen in the background)

- **SEE Pruning** 
- **Check Extensions**
- **MVA–LVV**
- **Quiet History**
- **Null Move Prunning (NMP)**
- **RFP**
- **Simple Probcut**
- **(and many others)**
